title: "Learning jekyll"

This post is about what I've been learning about Jekyll. I have not been able to do much experimentation during my regular work week, but I did run some tests at home. This would be made much easier on my home computer (Arch Linux) where I have administrative permissions. I have begun a new site that I am working on at home (no github repo yet) where I will be testing different jekyll templates and possibly making my own custom template. I need to become more familiar with Ruby and the jekyll syntax before I am ready to make my own custom template that isn't just complete garbage, and perhaps eventually, I'll be running my own movie streaming service . . . with blackjack . . . and hookers.

Sincerely, 

Klink
