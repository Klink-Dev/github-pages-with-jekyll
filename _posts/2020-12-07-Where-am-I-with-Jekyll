title: "Where am I with Jekyll?"
date: 2020-12-07

So, today I realized that I hadn't really looked into anything regarding Jekyll in the past 3 days. I will probably not continue with Jekyll today, as I have to work all day. I worked all day yesterday, and I will be working all day tomorrow, and for the next 5 days, then I get a day off followed by another 6 days of work. I feel like I could accomplish so much more in life if I didn't spend all day at work. Granted, I get to work on more projects that interest me in my current position than ever before, it's still adjacent to the knowledge I really want to obtain. If anyone sees this and has a solution to this dilema (job openings where I can really create things with code. I don't really care what language, I will learn it) please email me or create a pull request or something, just get my attention.

Sincerely, 

Klink
