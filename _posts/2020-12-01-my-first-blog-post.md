title: "Using jekyll"

Today I created my first page with jekyll. It was kind of fun, but I didn't learn a lot about how jekyll works and the page requires some debugging. Also I'm curious how the "subscribe via RSS" function works. So I'm making a list of the order in which I want to figure out the page. 
Page title is in the top right corner and twice above the page description. 
1. figure out why it is posting the title in all 3 places
  a. div class="trigger"
  b. H1 class="page-heading"
  c. H1 id="welcome-to-my-blog"
2. make it only show 1 or 2 of these instances
3. find additional functionality of jekyll that I can edit without ruby on rails
4. figure out how to change the background color or image
5. figure out how to make div tables using the jekyll format, or some other front end structuring
6. figure out how to subscribe to an RSS feed
  a. expected to be in "feed.xml"
